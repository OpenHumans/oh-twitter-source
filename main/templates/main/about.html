        <h2>Data access &amp; data management</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Twitter data:</b> The Twitter API gives this project ongoing
          access to data, which we will collect and store for you in
          Open Humans in an ongoing manner. This includes: your tweets with all
          their metadata (e.g. links to images, geolocation if provided),
          your liked tweets with all their metadata, your follower & following counts.
        </p>
        <p>
            Data files created by the app are stored in your Open Humans
            account and are always visible to you on the
            <a href="https://www.openhumans.org/activity/twitter-api-integration/">project
            activity page</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Twitter API also gives us access to data we will not copy into
          your Open Humans account, including: username, lists of your followers/followings, and
          other activities on their site. Access to this data is unavoidable
          due to how Twitter operates, but we won't store it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Other data:</b> This project stores tokens for Open Humans and
          Twitter authorizations, but has no further access to your Open Humans
          account data beyond the data files it stores.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Removing this connection:</b> You can visit the
          <a href="https://www.openhumans.org/activity/twitter-api-integration/">project
            activity page</a> in Open Humans to remove this connection within
            Open Humans and, optionally, delete associated data files.
        </p>
        <h2>Code &amp; deployment</h2>
        <p>
          This project website is an
          <a href="https://github.com/OpenHumans/oh-twitter-source">open source Django app</a>,
          and is deployed using
          <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>. It uses our
          <a href="https://www.openhumans.org/direct-sharing/oauth2-features/">standard APIs</a>
          to interact with the main platform. That means you could build something
          like it! We love to support projects created by others â€“ please chat with
          us in our <a href="http://slackin.openhumans.org">community slack</a>.
        </p>
